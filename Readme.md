This is a simple analysis of handwritten digit prediction and classification using the scikit-learn library. The goal is to create a Random Forest classifier to predict the digit represented by an 8x8 pixel image of a digit. The dataset used here is the digits dataset, which consists of 8x8 pixel images of handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.
